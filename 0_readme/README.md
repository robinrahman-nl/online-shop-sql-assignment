# Practical Assignment: Online Shop (SQL)

**Name:** Robin Rahman
**Context:** SQL practical assignment (Gallileo Academy)

## Goal
This project contains the implementation of a practical assignment in which a relational database for a fictitious online shop is designed and queried using SQL. The focus is on database design, data manipulation, queries, aggregations, and working with multiple related tables.

## Structure
The repository is logically structured per assignment component, such as database setup, data manipulation, queries, aggregations, and complex queries.  
The SQL files are the source of truth; generated database files are not included in version control.

## Data Initialization
To run the project from scratch:

1. Execute `schema.sql` to create and reset all tables
2. Execute `seed.sql` once to insert initial data
3. Execute `update.sql` to apply data updates


## Final Submission File
The file `final_submission.sql` contains the complete, consolidated solution for this assignment.
It includes:

- Database schema definition
- Seed data
- Data updates (UPDATE / DELETE)
- All required queries with explanatory comments

This file is intended for assessment and can be executed top-to-bottom on a clean MySQL database to fully reproduce the assignment results.

## Status
Completed.
This repository represents the finalized submission for the Online Shop SQL assignment at Galileo Academy.
