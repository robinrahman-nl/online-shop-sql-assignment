# Practical Assignment: Online Shop (SQL)

**Name:** Robin Rahman
**Context** SQL practical assignment (Gallileo Academy)

## Goal
This project contains the implementation of a practical assignment in which a relational database for a fictitious online shop is designed and queried using SQL. The focus is on database design, data manipulation, queries, aggregations, and working with multiple related tables.

## Structure
The repository is logically structured per assignment component, such as database setup, data manipulation, queries, aggregations, and complex queries.  
The SQL files are the source of truth; generated database files are not included in version control.

## Data initialization
- Run `schema.sql` to reset the database
- Run `manipulation.sql` once to seed initial data
- `manipulation.sql` is not idempotent by design

## Status
Work in progress.
This README file will be extended once the assignment is fully completed.
